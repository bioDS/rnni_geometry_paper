\section{Technical Introduction}

\summary{Introducing discrete time-trees and ranked trees}
A binary rooted phylogenetic tree is a binary tree on a fixed number $n$ of leaves, which are uniquely labelled by elements of the set $\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$.
The main objective of study in this paper, \emph{discrete time-trees}, are such binary rooted phylogenetic trees, where leaves are assigned time $0$, and internal nodes are assigned unique integer-valued times, such that an internal node always has time greater than its children.
We refer to the time of an internal node $v$ by $\ntime(v)$.
If not stated otherwise, we will refer to discrete time-trees simply as \emph{trees}.
The number of discrete time-trees with root time less or equal to $m$ is $\frac{(n-1)!n!m^{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$ \autocite{Gavryushkin2018-ol}.
Discrete time-trees with root time $n-1$ are called \emph{ranked trees}, and we say \emph{rank} of $v$ to mean its time ($\rank(v) = \ntime(v)$) in a ranked tree to be consistent with notations used in \autocite{Collienne2020-iu}.
Two trees are \emph{identical} if there is a graph isomorphism between them preserving leaf labels and times.

Every internal node $v$ of a tree $T$ can be referred to by the set $C$ of leaves that are descending from this node.
We call such a set $C$ \emph{cluster} and say that the cluster $C$ is \emph{induced} by $v$.
A ranked tree can then be seen as a list of clusters $[C_1, \ldots, C_{n-1}]$, where cluster $C_i$ is induced by the internal node with time $i$ for $i \in \{1, \ldots, n-1\}$.
For each subset $S \subseteq \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ we call the internal node of a tree $T$ with lowest time that is ancestral to all elements of $S$ the \emph{most recent common ancestor} of $S$ and denote it by $(S)_T$.
We denote the parent of a leaf $a_i$ in $T$ by $(a_i)_T$.

\summary{Defining the tree space $\dtt_m$ and $\rnni = \dtt_{n-1}$}
We are now ready to introduce the centre of study in this paper, $\dtt_m$, the graph (or space) of discrete time-trees, defined as follows.
The set of trees with root time less or equal to $m$ is the vertex set of $\dtt_m$ for a fixed integer $m$.
Trees $T$ and $R$ are connected by an edge if performing one of the following (reversible) operations on $T$ results in $R$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item An \emph{$\nni$ move} connects trees $T$ and $R$ if there is an edge $e$ in $T$ and an edge $f$ in $R$, both of length one, such that shrinking $e$ and $f$ to nodes results in identical trees.
	\item A \emph{rank move} on $T$ exchanges the times of two internal nodes with time difference one.
	\item A \emph{length move} on $T$ changes the time of an internal node by one.
\end{enumerate}
Note that a length move can only change the time of a node to $t$ if there is no node with time $t$ already.
Furthermore, our definition of $\dtt_m$ differs from the definition of \textcite{Gavryushkin2018-ol}, as length move are defined differently in their paper.

The definition of $\dtt_m$ leads to a natural definition of the \emph{distance} between two trees $T$ and $R$ in this graph as the length of a shortest paths between these trees, denoted by $d(T,R)$.
We also consider the ranked nearest neighbour interchange ($\rnni$) graph of \textcite{Collienne2020-iu}, which is the graph $\dtt_m$ for $m=n-1$, and hence a graph of ranked trees.
In this graph length moves are not possible, so we use the notion $\rnni$ \emph{move} to mean either a rank move or an $\nni$ move to distinguish these moves from length moves, even in $\dtt_m$.

\todefine{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We need to mention that $m$ is fixed when we compute distances between two trees
		\item $\rnni(\rho)$ -- in corresponding section
		\item intervals -- only needed in $\rnni(\rho)$ section (e.g. for Lemma~\ref{lemma:nni_path_to_caterpillar})
		\item $(T)_i$ for cluster induced by node of rank $i$ in $T$ -- this is only needed for proofs around $\rnni(\rho)$ and in the proof that every tree is connected to a caterpillar tree in $\rnni$ by a sequence of $\nni$ moves
	\end{itemize}

\section{Computing Shortest Paths in $\dtt$}

\todo{Do we want $\dtt$ or $\dtt_m$ in the titles of sections?}

\summary{Introduce how we can use $\findpath$ to compute $\dtt$ distances}
Distances between trees in $\rnni$ can be computed in quadratic running time with the algorithm $\findpath$, introduced by \textcite{Collienne2020-iu}.
As $\rnni$ is a special case of $\dtt_m$ for $m = n-1$, the question whether this algorithm can be generalised to compute distances in $\dtt_m$ arises.
Indeed, there is a way to use $\findpath$ to compute distances between trees in $\dtt_m$.
This works in two steps as it is briefly explained in the following, before we consider each of these steps in greater detail.
At first, leaves are added to both trees $T$ and $R$ in order to get two ranked trees $T_r$ and $R_r$ on with the same number of leaves.
Afterwards, we apply $\findpath$ to the pair of trees $T_r,R_r$, receiving the path $\fp(T_r,R_r)$.
With Theorem~\ref{thm:dtt_findpath} we see that this computes the distance $d(T,R)$ in $\dtt_m$ indeed.
To explain how ranked trees $T_r$ and $R_r$ can be received from adding leaves to trees $T$ and $R$, we assume that $T$ and $R$ are not ranked trees, as $\findpath$ could otherwise be applied to these trees directly.

\summary{How to add leaves to a $\dtt_m$ tree to transform it into a ranked tree}
Let $m$ to be the maximum time of the roots of $T$ and $R$.
To receive a ranked tree $T_r$ on $m+2$ leaves from $T$, we add leaves to $T$ as follows (\autoref{alg:ranked_tree}).
Note that the same can be done for $R$ to get a ranked tree $R_r$.
The root of $T_r$ is assigned time $m + 1$ and is connected to the root of $T$, such that one child of the root of $T_r$ is the subtree $T$.
\todo{Is this sentence sufficient to understand what's happening?}
The other subtree that is child of the root of $T_r$ is a caterpillar tree with leaves $\{a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots, a_{m+2}\}$, such that $\ntime(a_{n+1}) = \ntime(a_{n+2}) < \ntime(a_{n+3}) < \ldots < \ntime(a_{m+2})$ and the resulting tree is a ranked tree with $m+2$ leaves.
An example of this extension of a tree $T$ to a ranked tree $T_r$ is depicted in \autoref{fig:dtt_to_ranked_tree}.

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
	\caption{RankedTree($T$)}
	\label{alg:ranked_tree}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\STATE $S:= \{1 \leq i \leq m | \text{ no internal node in } T \text{ has time } i\}$
		\STATE $[i_1, \ldots, i_{m-n+1}] = sort(S)$
		\STATE $T_r := T$ with additional internal node $v_1$ with children $a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}$ and time $i_1$
		\FOR {$k = 2, \dots, m-n+1$}
			\STATE Add internal node $v_k$ with with children $v_{k-1}$ and $a_{n+k+1}$ and time $i_k$ to $T_r$
		\STATE add internal node $\rho$ with children $v_{m-n}$ and $(\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\})_{T_r}$ to $T_r$
		\ENDFOR
		\RETURN $T_r$
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\summary{How to compute shortest $\dtt$-paths between trees with $\findpath$}
After extending both trees $T$ and $R$ to ranked trees $T_r$ and $R_r$ on $m+2$ leaves, $\findpath$ can compute a shortest path between $T_r$ and $R_r$ in the $\rnni$ graph on $m+2$ leaves.
As we know that $\findpath$ preserves clusters, there are no $\nni$ moves in the newly added caterpillar tree with leaves in $\{a_{n+1}, \ldots, a_{m+2}\}$ on $\findpath$.
Therefore, the only moves involving internal nodes of this caterpillar subtree are rank moves.
Each of these rank moves can be seen as a length move in the subtree that is rooted in $\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$, when ignoring the rest of the tree.
Hence the path $\fp(T_r,R_r)$ provides a path between $T$ and $R$, when only considering the subtrees induced by $\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ in all trees on $\fp(T_r, R_r)$.
We denote this path in $\dtt_m$, which results from $\fp(T_r, R_r)$, by $\fp(T,R)$.
In \autoref{thm:dtt_findpath} we see that the $\fp(T,R)$ is a shortest path in $\dtt_m$ indeed.

\begin{theorem}
	The path $\fp(T,R)$ between two discrete time-trees $T$ and $R$ is a shortest path between these trees in $\dtt_m$, where $m$ is the maximum time of the root of $T$ and $R$.
	\label{thm:dtt_findpath}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	We assume to the contrary that $T$ and $R$ are discrete time-trees in $\dtt_m$ with a shortest path between them that is shorter than $\fp(T,R)$.
	Let $T_r$ and $R_r$ be the extended ranked versions of $T$ and $R$, computed with \autoref{alg:ranked_tree}.
	We have already seen above that length moves on $\fp(T,R)$ correspond to rank moves between nodes of the two subtrees directly descending from the roots of the ranked trees on this path.
	Furthermore, the order of leaves in the caterpillar subtrees that are added to $T$ and $R$ to receive $T_r$ and $R_r$ is identical.
	Therefore, any path in $\dtt_m$ from $T$ to $R$ gives a path between $T_r$ and $R_r$ in the $\rnni$ space on $m+2$ leaves, preserving the length of the path.
	If there was a path between $T$ and $R$ shorter than $\fp(T,R)$, the corresponding path between $T_r$ and $R_r$ in $\rnni$ would be shorter than the one computed by $\findpath$ in this space.
	Since this contradicts \autocite[Theorem 1]{Collienne2020-iu}, it follows that $\fp(T,R)$ is a shortest path in $\dtt_m$.
\end{proof}

\summary{$\findpath$ distance in $\dtt$ is sum of $\fp(T,R)$ in $\rnni$ and length moves -- essential for later proofs}
With \autoref{thm:dtt_findpath} we can compute shortest path between two trees in $\dtt_m$ in polynomial time, more specifically in time $\O(m^2)$.


\section{Geometrical Properties of $\dtt$}

\subsection{Cluster Property}
\summary{Definition of Cluster Property and why it is relevant.}
In this section we consider a property of tree spaces that seems to be connected to the computability of distances in these spaces.
We say that a tree space has the \emph{cluster property}, if all trees on every shortest paths between two trees sharing a cluster $C$ also contain this cluster.
It is known that the $\nni$ graph does not have the cluster property \autocite{Li1996-zw}, which has been used to prove that computing distances is $\np$-hard in $\nni$ \autocite{Dasgupta2000-xa}.

Computing distances in the $\rnni$ graph, however, can be done in polynomial time and the algorithm $\findpath$ for this \autocite{Collienne2020-iu} preserves common clusters.
The question, whether $\rnni$ has the cluster property is hence natural, and will be settled in \autoref{thm:cluster_property_rnni}.

\summary{$\rnni$ has the cluster property.}
\begin{theorem}
	The $\rnni$ graph has the cluster property.
	\label{thm:cluster_property_rnni}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	We assume the contrary, that is, there are two trees $T$ and $R$ sharing a cluster $C$ that is not present in all trees on a shortest path $p$.
	We furthermore assume that these trees have minimal distance among all pairs of trees violating the cluster property.
	Because of this minimality assumption on the length of $p$, the first tree $T'$ after $T$ on $p$ cannot contain $C$.
	Therefore, all nodes with rank below $(C)_T$ induce the same clusters in $T$ and $T'$.
	\todo{Is this obvious?}
	When running $\findpath$ on $T'$ and $R$ we can assume that the first cluster that is considered is $C$, also following from the minimality assumption on the length of $p$.
	If $C$ is the first cluster constructed on $\findpath$ starting it $T'$ to compute a path to $R$, the tree following $T'$ on this path is $T$, as it contains $C$ as a cluster.
	This however contradicts the assumption that $T'$ is on a shortest path from $T$ to $R$.
	Hence, there is no shortest path between $T$ and $R$ that does not preserve $C$ which shows that the $\rnni$ graph has the cluster property.
\end{proof}

\todo{motivate the following lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	Any shortest path between two trees $T$ and $R$ in $\dtt_m$ minimises both the number of $\rnni$ moves $r(T,R)$ and the number of length moves $l(T,R)$ between these trees.
	\label{lemma:dtt_path_sum}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Let $T$ and $R$ be trees in $\dtt_m$.
	Every shortest path between $T$ and $R$ can be interpreted as a path between $T_r$ and $R_r$, where $T_r$ and $R_r$ are the ranked trees computed with \autoref{alg:ranked_tree} for $T$ and $R$, respectively.

	The caterpillar subtrees $T_c$ and $R_c$ on the leaf subset $\{a_{n+1}, \ldots, a_{m+2}\}$, that are added to $T$ and $R$ by \autoref{alg:ranked_tree}, respectively, contain exactly the same clusters.
	Since clusters are preserved on shortest paths in $\rnni$ (\autoref{thm:cluster_property_rnni}), the only moves on any shortest path between $T_r$ and $R_r$ that effect internal nodes of the added caterpillar trees are rank moves.
	Therefore, the minimum number of moves needed to transform $T_c$ and $R_c$ is $\sum_{i = n+1}^{m+2} |\rank(a_{i})_{T_c} - \rank(a_{i})_{R_c}|$, which is the number rank of moves that $\findpath$ takes for these subtrees.

	The number of $\rnni$ moves is also minimal on $\fp(T,R)$, which we will see in the following.
	Assume that there was a path $p$ with less than $r(T,R)$ $\rnni$ moves between $T$ and $R$, where $r(T,R)$ is the number of $\rnni$ moves on $\fp(T,R)$.
	Then there is a path in $\rnni$ between ranked trees $\hat T$ and $\hat R$, which result from $T$ and $R$ by ignoring times of internal nodes and only keeping their ranks, with length $|p| < \fp(\hat T, \hat R)$, contradicting that $\findpath$ computes shortest paths in $\rnni$.

	It follows that $\findpath$ computes a shortest paths minimising both the number $r(T,R)$ of $\rnni$ moves and the number of length moves $l(T,R)$.
	Hence every shortest path in $\dtt_m$ has this property.
\end{proof}

With \autoref{lemma:dtt_path_sum} the cluster property in $\dtt_m$ follows from \autoref{thm:cluster_property_rnni}.

\begin{corollary}
	The graph $\dtt_m$ has the cluster property.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Caterpillar Trees}

\summary{Defining Caterpillar trees. Why are they interesting?}
In this subsection we focus on trees of a specific shape.
A \emph{caterpillar tree} is a tree where each internal node has at least one child that is a leaf.
If a path between two caterpillar trees only consists of caterpillar trees, we call this path a \emph{caterpillar path}.
The reason for caterpillar trees being an interesting objective of study is the fact that for any two caterpillar trees there always exists a shortest paths between them that is a caterpillar path.
For such a set of trees for which there is a shortest path in a graph that stays within this set we say that the set is \emph{convex} in $\rnni$.

\begin{theorem}
	The set of caterpillar trees is convex in $\rnni$.
	\label{thm:caterpillar_convex_rnni}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $T$ and $R$ be two caterpillar trees in $\rnni$.
	We show that there is always a tree with distance one to $T$ that is closer to $R$ than $T$, such that the existence of a caterpillar path that is a shortest path between $T$ and $R$ follows inductively.

	We consider the leaf $a_k := \argmax_{a_1, \ldots, a_n}\{\rank(a_i)_R | \rank(a_i)_R \neq \rank(a_i)_T\}$ to be the leaf with parent with maximum rank in $R$ that is not in the same position in $T$.
	Let $T'$ be the caterpillar tree resulting from $T$ by performing an $\nni$ move exchanging leaves $a_k$ and $a_j$, where $\rank(a_j)_T = \rank(a_k)_T + 1$.
	By using properties of shortest paths computed by $\findpath$, we now show that $|\fp(R,T')| = |\fp(R,T)| - 1$, which proves the theorem.

	Since all clusters of $T$ and $T'$ induced by nodes of rank less than $\rank(a_k)_T$ coincide, the paths $\fp(T,R)$ and $\fp(T',R)$ coincide up to a tree $R'$, which contains all these clusters.
	\todo{figure!}
	Let $S$ be the largest cluster that is shared between $R', T,$ and $T'$ (see \autoref{fig:proof_caterpillar_convex_rnni}).

	Since all these trees are caterpillar trees, the two next clusters considered on $\findpath(R,T)$ following $R'$ are $S \cup \{a_k\}$ and $S \cup \{a_k, a_j\}$.
	Decreasing the rank of $(S \cup \{a_k\})_{R'}$ takes $\rank(S \cup \{a_k\})_{R'} - (\rank(S)_{R'} + 1)$ $\rnni$ moves, the following iteration for $S \cup \{a_k, a_j\}$ takes $\rank(S \cup \{a_j\})_{R'} + 1 - (\rank(S)_{R'} + 2)$.
	In particular, the rank of the most recent common ancestor of $S \cup \{a_k, a_j\}$ equals the rank of the most recent common ancestor of $S \cup \{a_j\}$ after the first iteration following $R'$, as $a_j$ has parent with rank higher than $a_k$ at that point.
	Since the parents of $a_k$ and $a_j$ exchange while the rank of $(S \cup \{a_k\})_{R'}$ decreases, the rank of $(S \cup \{a_j\}$ decreases by one during that iteration, compared to $R'$.
	On $\findpath(R,T')$ first $\rank(S \cup \{a_j\})_{R'} - (\rank(S)_{R'} + 1)$ $\rnni$ moves are used to decrease the rank of $(S \cup \{a_j\})_{R'}$, and then $\rank(S \cup \{a_j, a_k\})_{R'} - (\rank(S)_{R'} + 2)$ for $S \cup \{a_k, a_j\}$.

	Let $Q$ and $Q'$ be the trees on $\fp(R,T)$ and $\fp(R,T')$, respectively, after the two iterations following $R'$.
	By the above the number of moves on $\fp(R,T)$ between $R'$ and $Q$ is one higher than the number of moves on $\fp(R,T')$ between $R'$ and $Q'$.
	Since the trees $Q'$ and $T'$ can be received from permuting the leaves of $Q$ and $T$ by the same permutation, namely the transposition $(a_j, a_k)$, the distances between these pairs of trees coincide: $d(Q,T) = d(Q',T')$.
	We can conclude $d(R,T) = d(R,T') + 1$, and hence $T'$ is on a shortest path from $T$ to $R$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	The set of caterpillar trees is convex in $\dtt_m$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	With \autoref{lemma:dtt_path_sum} it is sufficient to show that there is a caterpillar path between two caterpillar trees $T$ and $R$ that minimises the number of $\rnni$ moves $r(T,R)$ needed on any path between these two trees.
	This however follows immediately from the convexity of the set of caterpillar trees in $\rnni$ (\autoref{thm:caterpillar_convex_rnni}), which proves this corollary.
\end{proof}

\todo{writing}
\todo{Cite TSP paper -- caterpillar trees as special instance of TSP (lollipop graph)}

\todo{idea: this could be a lemma followed by a thm: caterpillar distances can be computed in $n \log$}
\begin{theorem}
	Let $T$ and $R$ be caterpillar trees in $\rnni$ such that \[1 = \rank(a_1)_R = \rank(a_2)_r < \rank(a_3)_R < \ldots < \rank(a_n)_R = n-1.\]
	Then it is
	\[d(T,R) = p_T - m_T,\]
	where $p_T$ is the number of transpositions in $T$ (Kendall-tau distance between $T$ and $R$) and $m_T = |M_T|$ for
	\begin{align*}
		M_T := &\{a_i| (\forall k \textnormal{ with } \rank(a_k)_T \leq \rank(a_i)_T: \rank(a_k)_R > \rank(a_i)_r)\} \\
		& \cap \{a_i | \rank(a_i)_T < \min\{\rank(a_1)_T, \rank(a_2)_T\}\}
	\end{align*}
	\label{thm:caterpillar_distance_formula}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\hat d(T,R) = p_T - m_T$, so we need to prove $\hat d(T,R) = d(T,R)$ for trees $T$ and $R$ as described above.
	It is sufficient to prove that for any caterpillar tree $T'$ with distance one to $T$ it is
	\begin{align}
		\hat d(T',R) \geq \hat d(T,R) - 1.
		\label{eq:distance_proof}
	\end{align}
	With this it follows by induction that $\hat d$ and $d$ coincide, using the \autoref{thm:caterpillar_convex_rnni}, the existence of a shortest path consisting only of caterpillar trees.

	To prove the correctness of Inequality~\ref{eq:distance_proof}, we first prove $p_{T'} \geq p_T - 1$ and then $m_{T'} \leq m_t + 1$.
	Then the only case in which Inequality~\ref{eq:distance_proof} does not hold is $p_{T'} = p_T - 1$ and $m_{T'} = m_t + 1$, which we will show to be impossible.

	As the only move possible between caterpillar trees $T$ and $T'$ is an $\nni$ move exchanging two leaves, at most one transposition of $T$ can be resolved in $T'$, resulting in $p_{T'} \geq p_T - 1$.
	Let $a_k, a_j$ be the labels of leaves that exchange their position between $T$ and $T'$, such that $\rank(a_k)_T < \rank(a_j)_T$.
	Since these are the only leaves that change positions between $T$ and $T'$, they are the only elements that could be in $M_{T'} \setminus M_T$.
	It remains to show $(M_{T'} \setminus M_T) \neq \{a_k, a_j\}$, from which we can follow $m_{T'} \leq m_T - 1$.

	We prove this by showing that if $a_k \notin M_T$, it follows either $a_k \notin M_{T'}$, or $a_j \notin M_{T'}$.
	If $a_k \notin M_T$, at least one of the following conditions must be violated for $i = k$:
	% Set counter for equation to get C1 and C2 for conditions
	\setcounter{equation}{0}
	\renewcommand{\theequation}{C\arabic{equation}}
	\begin{align}
		\forall l \text{ with } \rank(a_l)_T \leq \rank(a_i)_T: \rank(a_l)_R > \rank(a_i)_R \label{condition1}\\
		\rank(a_i)_T < \min\{\rank(a_1)_T, \rank(a_2)_T\}.
		\label{condition2}
	\end{align}
	% reset counter for future uses
	\setcounter{equation}{1}
	\renewcommand{\theequation}{\arabic{equation}}

	At first we consider the case that for $a_k$ Condition~\ref{condition1} is violated in $T$.
	It follows that there is a $l$ such that $\rank(a_l)_T < rank(a_k)_T$ and $\rank(a_k)_R > \rank(a_l)_R$.
	It immediately follows that the same condition is violated for $a_k$ in $T'$, because the $\nni$ move exchanging $a_k$ and $a_j$ preserves the relationship of $a_k$ and $a_l$.
	Therefore, it is $a_k \notin M_{T'}$.

	Let us now assume that Condition~\ref{condition2} is violated for $a_k$ to not be in $M_T$.
	It follows $\rank(a_k)_T \geq \min\{\rank(a_1)_T, \rank(a_2)_T\}$.
	As only $a_k$ and $a_j$ exchange between $T$ and $T'$, it follows $a_j \in \{a_1, a_2\}$, resulting in a violation of Condition~\ref{condition2} for $a_j$ in $T'$ and hence $a_j \notin M_{T'}$.
	We can conclude $(M_{T'} \setminus M_T) \neq \{a_k, a_j\}$, and hence $m_{T'} \leq m_T + 1$.

	It remains to show that if $p_{T'} = p_T - 1$, it cannot be $m_{T'} = m_T + 1$, in order to prove Inequality~\ref{eq:distance_proof}.
	We assume $p_{T'} = p_T - 1$, hence $(a_k, a_j)$ is a transposition in $T$, meaning that $\rank(a_k)_T < \rank(a_j)_T$ and $\rank(a_k)_R > \rank(a_j)_R$.
	As $a_k$ and $a_j$ are the only leaves whose membership can change between $M_T$ and $M_{T'}$, it suffices to show that none of them can be in $M_{T'} \setminus M_T$.

	That $a_k$ is not in $M_{T'}$ follows from $\rank(a_j)_{T'} < \rank(a_k)_{T'}$ and $\rank(a_j)_R < \rank(a_k)_R$, and hence $a_k \notin M_{T'} \setminus M_T$.
	Moreover, if $a_j \in M_{T'}$, it follows $a_j \in M_{T'}$, which yields $a_j \notin M_{T'} \setminus M_T$, as explained in the following.
	If $a_j \in M_{T'}$, both conditions \ref{condition1} and \ref{condition2} are met by $a_j$ in $T'$.
	With $\rank(a_k)_T < \rank(a_j)_T$ and $\rank(a_k)_R > \rank(a_j)_R$ it immediately follows that these conditions are also met in $T$, and hence $a_k \notin M_{T'} \setminus M_T$.

	Concluding, it is $M_{T'} \setminus M_T = \emptyset$, and we can follow that if $p_{T'} = p_T - 1$, it is $m_{T'} < m_T + 1$, which concludes this proof.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Diameter and Radius}

\summary{Definition of Diameter and that we consider it depending on $\rho$.}
In this section we want to investigate the diameters of $\rnni$ and $\dtt$, which is the greatest distance between any pair of vertices (trees) in each of these graphs, respectively, i.e. $\max\limits_{\text{trees }T,R}d(T,R)$.
We prove the diameter dor $\dtt$ before finding the diameter of $\rnni$ as a special case of $\dtt$.


\begin{theorem}
	The diameter of $\dtt_m$ is $m(n-1) - \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
	\label{thm:dtt_diameter}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $T$ and $R$ be two trees in $\dtt_m$ and $T_r$ and $R_r$ their ranked versions on $m+2$ leaves.
	In every iteration $i$ of $\findpath$ the maximum number of moves is $m-i$, as described following.
	Let $C$ be the cluster induced by the node of rank $i$ of $R$, and hence the cluster who's most recent common ancestor gets moved down in iteration $i$ of $\findpath$.
	The maximum rank of $(C)_T$ is $m$, as this is the rank of the root of the subtree containing all elements of $C$.
	And since the rank of the most recent common ancestor of $C$ decreases when running $\findpath$ until it reaches $i$, the maximum number of moves in iteration $i$ is $m-i$.
	Hence the sum of all moves needed over all iterations of $\findpath$ is
	\[\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n-1} (m - i) = m(n-1) - \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.\]
	This formula is not only an upper bound of the diameter of $\dtt_m$, there are trees with this distance.
	An example of such trees is provided in \autoref{fig:cat_max_dist_dtt} where the path computed by $\findpath$ has length $m(n-1) - \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
	These trees have maximum distance from each other as the maximum number of moves $m-i$ is reached in each iteration $i = 1, \ldots, n$.

		\caption{Trees with distance $m(n-1) - \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$}
		\label{fig:cat_max_dist_dtt}
	\end{figure}
\end{proof}

\todo{graphs are isomorphic?!}
Since the $\rnni$ graph is the graph $\dtt_{n-1}$, the diameter of $\rnni$ is a direct result of \autoref{thm:dtt_diameter}.

\begin{corollary}
	The diameter of $\rnni$ is $\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$.
	\label{cor:diameter_rnni}
\end{corollary}

\summary{Radius of $\rnni$ is equal to its diameter.}
\todo{This intro needs to be expanded. Can we come up with a more intuitive description of what the radius of a graph is?}
The radius of $\rnni$, which is defined $\min\limits_{\text{tree } T}\max\limits_{\text{tree }R} d(T,R)$, equals its diameter, results from the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
	For every tree in $\rnni$ exists a caterpillar tree with distance $\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$ from it.
	\label{lemma:max_dist_tree_rnni}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We prove this lemma by induction on the number of leaves $n$.
	The base case $n=3$ is trivial, as all three trees in this space are caterpillar trees with distance one from every other tree.
	For the induction step we consider an arbitrary tree $T$ with $n+1$ leaves.
	Let $x$ and $y$ be the leaved of $T$ that have the internal node of rank $1$ as parent in $T$, and let $T'$ be the tree on $n$ leaves resulting from deleting one of the leaves, say $x$, of $T$.
	By the induction hypothesis there is a caterpillar tree $R'$ with distance $\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$ to $T'$.
	Now consider the tree $R$ resulting from adding $x$ at the top of $R'$ such that the root of $R$ has $x$ and $R'$ as children.

	To compute a path from $R$ to $T$, in the first iteration of $\findpath$ the leaf $x$ moves down by $\nni$ moves until it reaches $y$.
	A further $\nni$ moves creates an internal node with children $x$ and $y$, which is then moved down by rank swaps as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:max_dist_ctree}.
	Altogether, there are $n-1$ $\rnni$ moves needed to build the cluster $\{x,y\}$ and decrease the rank of the node inducing this cluster until it reaches rank one, as the rank of the parent of $x$ decreases by one within every move, starting at the root with rank $n$ and ending at the internal node of rank one.
	The tree at the end of this first iteration on $\fp(T,R)$ is identical to $R'$ when removing the leaf $x$ and suppressing its parent.
	Since the cluster $\{x,y\}$ is not considered again in $\findpath$, the remaining part of $\fp(T,R)$ contains the same moves as $\fp(T',R')$, and hence $|\fp(T,R)| = |\fp(T',R')| + n-1$.
	Therefore it is $d(T,R) = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + n-1 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, which proves the lemma.
	\begin{figure}[ht]
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{max_dist_ctree.eps}
		\caption{Initial $n - 1$ $\rnni$ moves of $\fp(R,T)$ as described in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:max_dist_tree_rnni}.
		Removing the leaf $x$ and suppressing the non-root node of degree two from the tree on the right results in $R'$ as described in the lemma.}
		\label{fig:max_dist_ctree}
	\end{figure}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	The radius of the $\rnni$ graph equals its diameter $\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$.
\end{corollary}

Unlike in $\rnni$, the radius of $\dtt_m$ does not equal its diameter.
A counterexample is given by the tree depicted in \autoref{fig:dtt_radius_counterexample} on three leaves in $dtt_4$.There is no tree in $\dtt_4$ that has distance $m(n-1) - \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, which is the diameter of $\dtt_m$, from that tree.

	\caption{Tree in $\dtt_4$ on three leaves for which there is not tree with distance $5 = m(n-1) - \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ (diameter) from it}

\end{figure}


\section{$\rnni(\rho)$}

\todo{How can we connect $\rnni(\rho)$ to $\dtt$?}

\subsection{Caterpillar Trees}

\summary{The set of caterpillar trees is convex in $\rnni(\rho)$ for $\rho > 1$.}
\begin{corollary}
	The set of caterpillar trees is convex in $\rnni(\rho)$ if and ony if $\rho \geq 1$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	We start with proving that if the set of caterpillar trees is convex, then it is $\rho \geq 1$.
	More specifically, we show that if $\rho < 1$, then the set of caterpillar trees is not convex, from which the previous statement follows.
	Therefore we consider the following example of trees with four leaves.
	Let
	\begin{align*}
		T &= [\{1,2\},\{1,2,3\},\{1,2,3,4\}]\text{ and }\\
		R &= [\{3,4\},\{1,3,4\},\{1,2,3,4\}].
	\end{align*}
	The shortest among all caterpillar paths between $T$ and $R$ has length three and is depicted at the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:caterpillar_non_convex}.
	However, there is a path that is shorter than this path and has length $2 + \rho$, which is smaller than three for $\rho < 1$.
	This path is depicted at the top of Figure~\ref{fig:caterpillar_non_convex}.
	Hence, the set of caterpillar trees is not convex if $\rho < 1$.
	\begin{figure}[ht]
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{caterpillar_non_convex.eps}
		\caption{A shortest caterpillar path between caterpillar trees $T$ and $R$ at the bottom and a path consisting of non-caterpillar trees at the top.
		The path at the top is shorter than the one at the bottom for all $\rho<1$.}
		\label{fig:caterpillar_non_convex}
	\end{figure}

	It remains to prove that if $\rho \geq 1$, then the set of caterpillar trees is convex.
	With Theorem~\ref{thm:caterpillar_convex_rnni} we know that this is true for $\rho = 1$.
	Moreover, the statement for $\rho > 1$ follows from the same theorem as described in the following, where we assume that $\rho > 1$.
	All paths between any two trees in $\rnni(\rho)$ are longer or have equal length to the path containing the same moves in $\rnni$, as the weights of the moves in $\rnni(\rho)$ are greater or equal to the weights of the same moves in $\rnni$.
	Specifically, the only paths that have the same length in $\rnni$ and $\rnni(\rho)$ are paths that contain only $\nni$ moves.
	It follows that caterpillar paths of $\rnni$ have the same length in $\rnni(\rho)$, while other paths might be longer in $\rnni(\rho)$, but cannot be shorter than the same path in $\rnni$.s
	And as there is a shortest caterpillar path between all caterpillar trees in $\rnni$, this path is shortest path in $\rnni(\rho)$ as well.
	This proves that the set of caterpillar trees is convex in $\rnni(\rho)$ for $\rho \geq 1$, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Diameter and Radius}

\summary{Diameter for $\rnni(0)$ follows from $\nni$}
Not only for $\rnni$, but also for $\rnni(0)$, we know the diameter from previous results.
As rank moves in $\rnni(0)$ weigh zero, the distance between two trees in this space is the same as the $\nni$ distance between these trees when ignoring ranks.
Therefore, these graphs have the same diameter.

\begin{proposition}
	The diameter of $\rnni(0)$ is $\Theta(n \log(n))$.
	\label{prop:diameter_nni}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	This follows from the diameter of the $\nni$ graph, which is known \autocite{Semple2003-nj} to be $\Theta(n \log(n))$.
\end{proof}

\summary{Results for $\rnni$ and $\rnni(0)$ give us bounds for the diameters of all spaces with $0 < \rho < 1$.}
With the previous results in Corollary~\ref{cor:diameter_rnni} and Proposition~\ref{prop:diameter_nni} we can infer bounds for diameters of spaces $\rnni(\rho)$ with $0 < \rho < 1$.
A path in $\rnni(\rho)$ between two trees corresponds to paths in $\rnni(0)$ and $\rnni(1)$ that contain the same moves, but have different total length, due to the different weighing of rank moves.
Therefore, the length of such a path is bounded from below by the length of the corresponding path in $\rnni(0)$ and from above by the corresponding path in $\rnni(1)$.
With Corollary~\ref{cor:diameter_rnni} and Proposition~\ref{prop:diameter_nni} it follows that the diameter of $\rnni(\rho)$ with $\rho < 1$ is bounded from below by $\Theta(n \log(n))$ and from above by $\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$.

\summary{Diameter of $\rnni(\rho)$ for $\rho > 1$.}
So far $\rnni(\rho)$ for $0 \leq \rho \leq 1$ has been the centre of our investigation of diameters.
We now continue by considering spaces $\rnni(\rho)$ for $\rho > 1$, where rank moves are more expensive than $\nni$ moves.
Specifically, we give an upper bound for the diameter of $\rnni(\infty)$ from which we can follow that all spaces $\rnni(\rho)$ have a diameter less or equal to this bound.
\todo{Refer to \autoref{lemma:nni_path_to_caterpillar} or move the lemma here}
Before this, however, we need to observe that for $\rnni(\infty)$ every pair of trees is connected by a path consisting of $\nni$ moves only.

\summary{Every tree in $\rnni$ can be connected to a caterpillar tree by $\nni$ moves only, hence there is a path between very pair of trees that consists of $\nni$ moves only}
\begin{lemma}
	In $\rnni$ every tree is connected to a caterpillar tree by a path that consists of $\nni$ moves only.
	\label{lemma:nni_path_to_caterpillar}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	We prove this lemma for a given tree $T$ by induction on the number $i$ of rank intervals of $T$.
	In the base case $k = 0$ the tree $T$ is a caterpillar tree and the statement is true.
	For the induction step we assume that $T$ has $i+1$ rank intervals and all trees with less than $i+1$ rank intervals are connected to a caterpillar trees through a sequence of $\nni$ moves.
	We now construct a series of $\nni$ moves that, starting at $T$, ends in a tree that has less than $i+1$ rank intervals.
	Let the node of rank $k+1$ in $T$ be the highest ranked node incident to a rank interval.
	This means that the interval given by nodes of rank $k$ and $k+1$ is a rank interval and all intervals above $(T)_{k+1}$ are edges.
	Let $(T)_l$ be the parent of $(T)_k$.
	Hence $l > k+1$, and $[(T)_{l-1}, (T)_{l}]$ is an edge.
	On this edge an $\nni$ move can be performed that results in a tree $T'$ in which the rank of the parent of $(T')_k$ is $l-1$, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:nni_path_caterpillar}.
	In the tree $R$ resulting from iteratively repeating this until $l = k+1$ the parent $(R)_k$ has rank $k+1$.
	Hence the rank interval bounded by nodes of rank $k$ and $k+1$ in $T$ turned into an edge while all intervals above $k+1$ remain edges in $R$.
	As $R$ has one rank interval less than the $i+1$ rank intervals of $T$, the induction hypothesis can be applied to $R$.
	This gives a sequence from $T$ to a caterpillar via $R$ that consists of $\nni$ moves only.

		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{nni_path_caterpillar.eps}
		\caption{Example of a tree $T$ with two rank intervals and a sequence of $\nni$ moves that results in a tree $R$ with one rank interval as described in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:nni_path_to_caterpillar}.}
		\label{fig:nni_path_caterpillar}
	\end{figure}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
	The diameter of $\rnni(\infty)$ is less or equal to $3 \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	Let $T$ and $R$ be two trees in $\rnni(\infty)$.
	With Lemma~\ref{lemma:nni_path_to_caterpillar} we know that any tree can be connected to a caterpillar tree by a sequence of $\nni$ moves.
	Moreover, the proof of the lemma implicitly proposes an algorithm to convert a tree into a caterpillar tree by removing rank intervals by a top-down approach.
	We show that the paths from a tree to a caterpillar tree that are given by this algorithm have at most length $\frac{(n-1)(n-1)}{2}$.
	Since we also know that the set of caterpillar trees is convex in $\rnni$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:caterpillar_convex_rnni}), and hence the maximum distance between caterpillar trees is bounded by the diameter $\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$ of $\rnni$ (Corollary~\ref{cor:diameter_rnni}), this corollary follows.

	For finding the maximum length of a path computed by the algorithm suggested in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:nni_path_to_caterpillar}, we consider every iteration (induction step).
	In each of these, at least one rank interval turns into an edge.
	The number of $\nni$ moves needed for this depends on the rank of the upper node bounding the rank interval.
	If we assume the worst case, that is, every interval except for the edge $[(T)_{n-1},(T)_{n-2}]$ is a rank interval, then there are $i$ $\nni$ moves needed in iteration $i$.
	Since there are $n-2$ iterations, it follows that at most $\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$ $\nni$ moves are needed to get from an arbitrary tree to a caterpillar tree.
	\todo{I suspect writing the algorithm down properly and using it to prove Lemma~\ref{lemma:nni_path_to_caterpillar} and this corollary might be easier than this. This explanation of the 'implicitly' defined algorithm is not sufficient.}
